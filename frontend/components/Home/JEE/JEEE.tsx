            <h1>What is the IIT JEE Main & Advanced Exam?</h1>
            <p>
              The IIT JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) is like the gateway to a dream for students who aspire to study in India's prestigious engineering institutes. It's a two-part exam—JEE Main and JEE Advanced-and both are required for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).
            </p>
            <p>
              JEE Main is the first step, open to all students, and it’s used for admissions to NITs, IIITs, and other engineering colleges as well. It tests students on subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Math-focusing on fundamental concepts.
            </p>
            <p>JEE Advanced is the next level, but only those who score well in JEE Main can sit for it. This is where the competition heats up! The questions here are more challenging, designed to test not only knowledge but problem-solving skills and the ability to apply concepts in tricky situations. It’s the exam that gets you into the IITs, the dream destination for many aspiring engineers.
            </p>
            <p>
              But more than just an exam, JEE is a journey. It’s about hard work, dedication, and the belief that you can achieve something incredible. At The AtoZ Classes, we help students prepare for this journey by simplifying complex concepts and offering guidance every step of the way. Whether your child is just starting to prepare or needs help with those final stretches, we’re here to support them in every way we can.</p>

                  <dd className="ml-0">
                    A4: The "state of eligibility" for JEE Main refers to the state in which a student is eligible to apply for admission based on their place of residence or the location of their qualifying examination. Here’s a breakdown:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>State of Residence:</strong> This is the state where the student has been a resident for a significant period or the state in which they have completed their Class 12th or equivalent examination. It’s important because some states may have specific reservation policies or eligibility criteria for local residents.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>State of Schooling:</strong> This refers to the state where the student has studied and completed their qualifying examination (Class 12th or equivalent). For instance, if a student has completed their Class 12th from a school in Maharashtra, then Maharashtra is considered their state of schooling.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Home State and Other State Quotas:</strong> During the admission process, particularly for government-funded institutions like NITs and IIITs, there are often two types of quotas:
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Home State Quota:</strong> This is for students who are residents of the state where the institution is located. For example, if you are from Uttar Pradesh and are applying to an NIT in Uttar Pradesh, you will be considered under the home state quota.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <strong>Other State Quota:</strong> This applies to students from other states who are applying to institutions outside their home state.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Domicile Requirements:</strong> Some institutions might have specific domicile requirements, meaning the student must have been a resident of the state for a certain number of years or have completed their schooling there. These details can vary, so it’s good to check the specific requirements of the institution to which you’re applying.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Key Points:
                    </b></p>
                    <p>The state of eligibility impacts how students are considered during the admission process and can affect their chances of getting admission based on state quotas. <br />
                      Always check the official guidelines and brochures for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding state eligibility. <br />

                  <dd className="ml-0">
                    A5: In cases where a candidate has passed their Class 12th examination from one state but appeared for improvement exams in another state, the "state of eligibility" for JEE Main is generally determined based on the following factors:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>State of Residence:</strong> Typically, the state where the student has been a resident or has their primary place of residence is considered. This is often the state that is used for eligibility and quota purposes.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>State of Schooling:</strong> For JEE Main, the state where the student completed their regular Class 12th examination is usually considered. This means if a student passed Class 12th from a school in State A but appeared for improvement exams in State B, State A, where they completed their original schooling, is generally considered their state of eligibility.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Institutional Policies:</strong> Some institutions might have specific rules regarding the state of eligibility, especially if improvement exams are taken. It’s always a good idea to check the guidelines of the specific institution or the JEE Main official website for any specific instructions related to improvement exams.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Application Form Details:</strong> When filling out the JEE Main application form, students should provide accurate information about their state of schooling and residence. This information is used to determine their eligibility and to apply any state-specific quotas or reservations.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>
                      In Summary:
                    </b></p>
                    <p>For most purposes, the state where the student originally passed Class 12th is considered their state of eligibility. <br />
                      If there are any doubts or if the improvement exam impacts eligibility in any special way, checking with the official JEE Main guidelines or contacting the examination authorities can provide clarity. <br />
