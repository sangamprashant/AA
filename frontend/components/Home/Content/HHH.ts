      <h2 id="what-are-numbers">What are Numbers?</h2>
    <p>
      Numbers are a fundamental part of mathematics. Numbers are used to count,
      measure, order and index. We know different types of numbers according to
      their nature such as natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational
      numbers, whole numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, even and odd
      numbers etc. We can apply basic arithmetic operations on numbers and the
      resulting number is . Originally, tally paper was used before numerals
      were used. Now let us introduce the concept of numbers and understand its
      different types and properties.
    </p>

    <h3 id="number-definition">Number Definition</h3>
    <p>
      Numbers are mathematical values ​​that are represented by words, symbols
      or numbers that represent quantities. Numbers are used for counting and
      calculations.
    </p>

    <h3 id="introduction-to-numbers">Introduction to Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Numbers form the basis of mathematics. To understand mathematics you need
      to become familiar with numbers. There are different types of numbers.
      There is a long list including ordinals, consecutive numbers, odd, even,
      natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, real numbers, rational numbers,
      irrational numbers, and complex numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to numbers, you will also encounter the interesting world of
      divisors and multiples. This world includes primes, composite numbers,
      coprimes, perfect numbers (yes, numbers can be perfect!), HCF, P/E, and
      prime factorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start your numbers journey. You can explore all the important topics in
      Numbers by choosing a topic from the list below.

    <h3 id="math-before-number-building">Math Before Number Building</h3>
    <p>
      Building skills before number building is a prerequisite for understanding
      numbers. Pre-quantification skills like allocating, sorting, classifying,
      arranging and comparing are the foundation for a deep understanding of
      numbers. Pre-school math skills are taught in kindergarten. Children learn
      how to stand before they can take even a small step. Similarly,
      pre-quantification concepts are very important for children to start
      understanding mathematics. In this section, we will discuss various
      pre-quantification concepts like allocating and sorting, comparing and
      ordering, classifying, shapes and patterns, etc.

    <h3 id="number-names">Number Names</h3>
    <p>
      Number names are utilized to speak to numbers in an in sequential order
      arrange. A particular word is utilized to allude to each number. To type
      in a number in words in English, we ought to know the put esteem of each
      digit within the number.

    <h3 id="number-systems">Number Systems</h3>
    <p>
      The decimal number framework is the foremost commonly utilized number
      framework . The digits to 9 are utilized to speak to numbers. A digit in
      any given number includes a put esteem. The decimal number framework is
      the standard framework for signifying integrability and non-integers. We
      utilize the decimal number framework for the representation of Numbers up
      to 2-Digits , Numbers up to 3-Digits , Numbers up to 4-Digits , Numbers up
      to 5-Digits , Numbers up to 6-Digits , Numbers up to 7-Digits , Numbers up
      to 8-Digits , Numbers up to 9-Digits and Numbers up to 10-Digits ..
    </p>

    <h3 id="sorts-of-numbers">Sorts of Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      The diverse sorts of numbers depend on the properties that they have. For
      illustration, normal numbers are checking numbers that begin from 1,
      whereas, whole numbers begin from 0, prime numbers are as it were
      detachable by 1 and the number itself, and so on. Let us learn more almost
      the diverse sorts of numbers within the taking after areas.
    </p>

    <h3 id="numbers-chart">Numbers Chart</h3>
    <p>
      There are distinctive sorts of numbers that are utilized, but the foremost
      commonly utilized numbers can be classified as per their special
      properties. Observe the numbers chart which appears the sorts of numbers
      that are included beneath genuine numbers and all numbers separated from
      real numbers are named as complex numbers.
    </p>

    <h3 id="cardinal-and-ordinal-numbers">Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      A cardinal number could be a number that indicates the tally of any
      question. Any common number such as 1, 2, 3, etc., is alluded to as a
      cardinal number, though, an ordinal number could be a number that
      indicates the position or put of an protest. For illustration, 1st, 2nd,
      3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. It shows the arrange of things or objects, such as to
      begin with, moment, third, fourth, and so on.
    </p>

    <h4>Illustration:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the table given underneath which appears the contrast between
      Cardinal numbers and Ordinal numbers. Ordinal numbers offer assistance
      characterize the position of the children. Such as, Jim is the fourth
      child from the cleared out.
    </p>

    />

    <h3 id="sequential-numbers">Sequential Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Sequential numbers are numbers that take after each other in arrange from
      the littlest number to the biggest number. They ordinarily have a
      distinction of 1 between each two numbers.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the figure given underneath which appears a list of sequential
      numbers.
    </p>

    />

    <h3 id="integrability">Integrability</h3>
    <p>
      Integrability are numbers that comprise of entirety numbers and negative
      numbers. All integrability are spoken to by the letter set Z and do not
      have a decimal or a fragmentary portion. A number line is full of
      integrability. On the cleared out side, you'll find negative integers
      while on the correct side you have the positive ones. Do not disregard the
      zero in between!
    </p>
    <p>Z = { ...., -4, -3, -2, -1, , 1, 2, 3, 4,....}</p>

    <h3 id="natural-and-entirety-numbers">Natural Numbers and Entirety Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Natural Numbers and Entirety Numbers A common number may be a non-negative
      numbers and is always greater than zero. It is spoken to by the image N.
      It ought to be famous that entire numbers don't contain any decimal or
      fragmentary portion. They are spoken to by the image W.
    </p>

    <h3>Common numbers and entirety numbers - Representation</h3>
    <h4>Indeed Numbers and Odd Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      Indeed numbers are those numbers that can be partitioned into two rise to
      bunches or sets and are precisely detachable by 2. For illustration, 2, 4,
      6, 8, 10, and so on. In other words, these are entire numbers that are
      precisely distinct by 2.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the taking after figure which appears that indeed numbers are
      totally detachable by 2.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgf9aqq8o/image/upload/v1728667845/numbers-1-8_ouug6f.png"
      alt=""
      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />
    <p>
      Odd numbers are entire numbers that cannot be totally partitioned by 2.
      These numbers cannot be orchestrated in sets. Interests, all the entirety
      numbers but the products of 2 are odd numbers.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the taking after figure which appears that odd numbers are not
      totally distinct by 2 and when they are isolated by 2 we get 1 as the
      leftover portion.
    </p>

      alt=""
      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />
    <p>
      Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers A prime number could be a number that
      has precisely two components, 1 and the number itself. For illustration,
      2, 5, 7, 11, and so on are prime numbers . It can be said that any
      entirety number more noteworthy than 1 that has precisely two components,
      1 and itself is characterized to be a prime number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, presently we know that a prime number has fair two factors,1 and the
      number itself. A composite number may be a number that has more than two
      variables, which suggests it can be separated by the number 1 and itself,
      and at slightest one more numbers. It can too be said that any number more
      noteworthy than 1 that's not a prime number, is characterized to be a
      composite number. Composite numbers continuously have more than 2
      variables. For illustration, 6, 8, 9, 12, and so on are composite numbers
      since these numbers have more than 2 variables.
    </p>
    <pre>
Variables of 6 = 1, 2, 3, 6 (variables other than 1 and 6)
Components of 8 = 1, 2, 4, 8 (variables other than 1 and 8)
Components of 9 = 1, 3, 9 (variables other than 1 and 9)
Components of 12 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 (variables other than 1 and 12)
                    </pre
    >

    <h3>Co-prime Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      In the event that a match of numbers has no common figure separated from
      1, at that point they are called co-prime numbers . In other words, a set
      of numbers or integrability which have as it were 1 as their common
      calculate, which suggests their most elevated common figure (HCF) will be
      1, are co-primes. These are too known as commonly prime numbers or
      relatively prime numbers. Too, there ought to be two numbers in arrange to
      create co-primes.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      The taking after figure appears two co-prime numbers 8 and 15 that have as
      it were 1 as their common figure.
    </p>
    <img

      alt=""
      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />

    <h3>Culminate Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Idealize numbers are the positive integrability that are rise to to the
      entirety of its components but for the number itself. In other words,
      culminate numbers are the positive integrability that are the entirety of
      their appropriate divisors . The littlest culminate number is 6, which is
      the whole of its appropriate divisors: 1, 2 and 3
    </p>
    <h5>Illustration</h5>
    <p>
      The taking after figure appears that 6 could be a culminate number since
      the entirety of its variables (1,2,3) leads to 6.
    </p>

    <h3>Divisions and Decimals</h3>
    <p>
      Divisions are a portion of a entire. They are spoken to by numbers that
      have two parts to them and they are isolated by a division bar. There's a
      number at the best, which is called the numerator , and the number at the
      foot is called the denominator .
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      The taking after figure appears a division in which 1 is the numerator and
      4 is the denominator.
    </p>

    <h3>Complex Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      A complex number may be a number that can be communicated within the frame
      (a + bi) where a and b are genuine numbers, and i could be a arrangement
      of the condition x 2 = −1. Since no genuine number fulfills this
      condition, i is called an fanciful number . Complex numbers have a genuine
      portion and an imaginary portion. Hold up, do you think Complex numbers
      are really complex? Well, let us think about them in detail to find out.
      In this section, we cover distinctive subjects like Complex Numbers –
      Focuses within the Plane, A Complex Number could be a Point within the
      Plane, What is i? Size and Contention, Powers of particle , Expansion, and
      Subtraction of Complex Numbers, Increase of Complex Numbers, Conjugate of
      a Complex Number , Division of Complex Numbers, Addition, Subtraction, and
      Elucidation of |z1-z2|.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the figure given underneath which appears that a complex number
      comprises of genuine numbers and an nonexistent portion
    </p>

      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />

    <h3>Variables and Products</h3>
    <p>
      Variables and products are the two key concepts that are examined
      together. Variables are the numbers that separate the given number totally
      without clearing out any leftover portion, though the products are the
      numbers that are duplicated by the other number to induce particular
      numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Components of a given number are numbers that can flawlessly partition
      that given number.
    </p>
    <h5>Cases:</h5>
    <pre>
Components of 6:
1, 2, 3, 6
Components of 8:
1, 2, 4, 8
Variables of 14:
1, 2, 7, 14
Components of 36:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 18, 36
</pre
    >
    <p>
      A multiple of a number could be a number gotten by duplicating the given
      number by another entirety number.
    </p>
    <h5>Cases:</h5>
    <pre>
Products of 3:
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ......
Products of 5:
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, .....
Products of 10:
10, 20, 30, 40, 50,...
Products of 12:
12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ....
    </pre>
    <p>Most elevated Common Calculate (HCF)</p>
    <p>
      The Most elevated Common Calculate (HCF) of the two numbers is the biggest
      entirety number which may be a figure of both. It is additionally called
      the Most prominent Common Factor(GCF) .
    </p>
    <h5>Case:</h5>
    <p>
      Watch the following figure which appears the HCF of 15 and 21 which is 3.
    </p>

      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />

    <h3>Slightest Common Different (LCM)</h3>
    <p>
      When we consider two numbers, each will have its claim set of products. A
      few products will be common to both numbers. The littlest of these common
      products is called the Slightest Common Numerous (LCM) of the two numbers.
    </p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p>
      Observe the taking after figure which appears the LCM of 8 and 10 which is
      40.

    <h3>Prime Factorization</h3>
    <p>
      Prime factorization permits us to write any number as a item of prime
      components. It could be a way of communicating a number as a item of its
      prime components. To do prime factorization, we got to break a number down
      to its prime variables.
    </p>
    <h5>Case:</h5>
    <p>
      Watch the figure given underneath which appears the prime factorization of
      12

    <h3>Properties of Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      The fundamental properties of numbers that are utilized in arithmetic are:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Commutative Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        This property of numbers pertains to addition and multiplication. It is
        expressed as: a + b = b + a and a × b = b × a.
      </dd>

      <dt>Associative Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        This property of numbers pertains to addition and multiplication. It is
        expressed as: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a × (b × c) = (a × b) × c.
      </dd>

      <dt>Distributive Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        The product of the sum of two numbers and a third number is equal to the
        sum of the product of each addend and the third number. It is expressed
        as: a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c.
      </dd>

      <dt>Identity Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        There is an additive identity equal to 0 and a multiplicative identity
        equal to 1. It is expressed as: a + 0 = a and a × 1 = a.
      </dd>

      <dt>Reflexive Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        This property states that each number is equal to itself. It is
        expressed as: for all a, a = a.
      </dd>

      <dt>Symmetric Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        If a number x is equal to y, then y is also equal to x. It is expressed
        as: if x = y, then y = x.
      </dd>

      <dt>Transitive Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        If x is equal to y and y is equal to z, then we can say that x is equal
        to z. It is expressed as: if x = y and y = z, then x = z.
      </dd>

      <dt>Inverse Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        When an arithmetic operation is applied between a number and its
        inverse, we get the identity. It is expressed as: a + (-a) = 0 and a ×
        (1/a) = 1.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Critical Notes</h3>

        Geometry, derived from the Greek words "geo" (earth) and "metron"
        (measurement), is a mathematical discipline focused on the properties of
        shapes, sizes, distances, and angles. It also explores spatial
        relationships and postulates about objects and space. Below, we explore
        some key topics in geometry.

  measurement: `<p>
        Measurement is the process of comparing an unknown quantity with a
        standard, known value. The outcome is usually expressed as a numerical
        value accompanied by a unit. We use measurement to quantify various
        attributes such as length, mass, volume, and temperature. This article
        explores the basics of measurement, conversions, and the various units
        used.

        <h2>What is Measurement?</h2>
        <p>
          Measurement is the method by which we determine the size, amount, or
          degree of something using numbers. For instance, comparing two rods
          without precise figures only gives limited information, but by stating
          that one rod is 20 inches and another is 15 inches, we understand the
          difference clearly – the first rod is 5 inches longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mathematics, measurement is a key area that encompasses the study
          of units, conversions, and measuring quantities such as length, mass,
          and time. It also connects with other branches like geometry
          (measuring areas and volumes), trigonometry (heights and distances),
          and algebra (expressing relationships using variables). Before we dive
          into different units, let's first familiarize ourselves with some
          common abbreviations for measurement units.

        <h2>Measurement Units</h2>
        <p>
          There are several units depending on what is being measured. For
          example, the units for length include meters and inches, while mass
          can be measured in grams or pounds. Measurement systems are divided
          into two main categories: the Metric System and the U.S. Standard
          System (Imperial System). The metric system uses millimeters,
          centimeters, and meters, while the U.S. system relies on inches, feet,
          and miles.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Measurement Conversion</h2>
        <p>
          In order to perform calculations or comparisons, units need to be
          converted to a common form. For example, you can add 10 meters to 12
          meters to get 22 meters, but you can't add meters to inches without
          first converting one to the other. Conversion charts and formulas help
          us transition between units in the same or different systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters, converting 5 inches
          would involve multiplying 5 by 2.54, resulting in 12.7 centimeters.
          Similarly, we can convert between the Metric and U.S. systems.

        <h2>Measuring Length</h2>
        <p>
          Length can be measured using both informal and formal methods.
          Informal methods might include using hand spans or thread, while
          formal methods use tools like rulers and measuring tapes with standard
          units like meters and feet. Here are some key conversions:

        <h2>Measuring Mass</h2>
        <p>
          Mass refers to the quantity of matter in an object. We measure mass
          using grams, kilograms, pounds, and other units. These conversions are
          essential in switching between Metric and U.S. systems:
        </p>

        <h3>Metric System:</h3>
        <ul class="list-group mb-4">
          <li class="list-group-item">1 gram = 1000 milligrams</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">1 kilogram = 1000 grams</li>

        <h2>Measuring Time</h2>
        <p>
          Time is measured using seconds, minutes, hours, days, and years. A
          leap year, for example, occurs every four years and consists of 366
          days. Century years like 2000 must be divisible by 400 to be
          considered a leap year.

  algebra: `
  <p class="lead">
        Algebra is a fundamental area of mathematics that focuses on expressing
        problems or scenarios using mathematical symbols. It incorporates
        variables such as <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>, and
        <strong>z</strong> alongside mathematical operations like addition,
        subtraction, multiplication, and division to create meaningful
        expressions. Algebra is essential to various mathematical disciplines,
        including trigonometry, calculus, and coordinate geometry. A simple
        algebraic expression could be represented as
        <strong>2x + 4 = 8</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, algebra deals with symbols representing numbers or values
        that can change, connected by operators. It's not merely a mathematical
        concept; it’s a skill we often use in our daily lives, often without
        realizing it. Understanding algebra is crucial, as it provides a
        foundation for all future mathematical topics you will encounter.
      </p>

      <h3>1. What is Algebra?</h3>
      <p>
        Algebra is a branch of mathematics that utilizes symbols to represent
        numbers and the arithmetic operations applied to them. These symbols,
        known as variables, do not have fixed values. In practical situations,
        we frequently encounter changing values, which algebra helps to express.
        Variables such as <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>,
        <strong>z</strong>, <strong>p</strong>, or <strong>q</strong> represent
        these values, and through various arithmetic operations—addition,
        subtraction, multiplication, and division—we can manipulate these
        symbols to find specific values.

        <strong>Algebraic Equation</strong>: Algebraic expressions consist of
        variables, operators, and constants. For instance, in the expression
        <strong>2x + 4 = 8</strong>, the numbers <strong>4</strong> and
        <strong>8</strong> are constants, while <strong>x</strong> represents
        the variable, and addition is the operation performed.

        <p>Trigonometry has practical applications in many fields, including architecture, navigation, astronomy, and physics. It is used, for example, to determine the height of structures based on angle measurements, and also in sky calculations and electronics.</p>
        
        <h3>Real-life Trigonometry Example</h3>
        <p>Imagine someone standing next to a tree and wants to know its height without physically measuring it. If you know the distance from the tree and the elevation angle, you can use the tangent function to determine the height:</p>
        <p><em>tan θ = height / distance</em></p>
        
        <p>For example, if the distance is 30 meters and the elevation angle is 45°, the tree is 30 meters tall because:</p>
        <p><em>height = distance × tan(θ) = 30 m × tan(45°) = 30 m</em></p>

        <h2 id="section4" class="mt-4">4. Calculus</h2>
        <p>Calculus focuses on solving problems to find the rate of change of a function with respect to another variable. To find the optimal solution, we use derivatives to calculate the maximum and minimum values of a function.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Limits</h3>
        <p>Limits are useful for calculating the degree of closeness to a given value or approaching term. Limits are usually expressed using the limit formula:</p>
        <p class="font-italic">lim<sub>x→c</sub> f(x) = A</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Derivatives</h3>
        <p>Derivatives represent the instantaneous rate of change of one quantity with respect to another. The derivative of a function is expressed as:</p>
        <p class="font-italic">lim<sub>x→h</sub> [f(x + h) − f(x)]/h = A</p>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Continuity</h3>
        <p>A function f(x) is called continuous at x = a if the following three conditions are met:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>f(a) is defined</li>
            <li>lim<sub>x→a</sub> f(x) exists</li>
            <li>lim<sub>x→a</sub> f(x) = f(a)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="mt-3">Continuity and Differentiability</h3>
        <p>A function is always continuous and differentiable at all points, but the converse condition is not always true.</p>

        <h2 id="section5" class="mt-4">5. Integral Calculus</h2>
        <p>Integral Calculus is the study of integrals and related properties. It is useful in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calculating f from f ' (i.e., from its derivative).</li>
            <li>Calculating the area under the curve of any function.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-3">Integration</h3>
        <p>Integration is the inverse process of differentiation. Differentiation can be understood as dividing a part into many small parts, while integration is accumulating the small parts to make a whole. It is usually used to calculate areas.</p>

        <h2 id="section6" class="mt-4">6. Calculus Formulas</h2>
        <p>Calculus formulas can be broadly divided into six sets of formulas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limit Formulas</li>
            <li>Differential Formulas</li>
            <li>Integral Formulas</li>
            <li>Definite Integrals Formulas</li>
            <li>Applications of Differentiation Formulas</li>
            <li>Differential Equations Formulas</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="section7" class="mt-4">7. Applications of Calculus</h2>
        <p>Calculus has numerous applications across various fields, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Physics: To calculate motion, electricity, heat, light, harmonics, and waves.</li>

  ComercialMaths: `<p class="text-justify">
        Commercial math deals with all those concepts that individuals utilize
        in their daily lives. The term 'commercial' itself implies the temperate
        world or something relating to buying or selling. It includes the
        concepts of profit and loss, discounts, marked price, simple and
        compound interest, taxes, proportion and ratio, percentages, and
        everything that revolves around money. Let's learn about commercial math
        and all its sub-branches in detail in this lesson.

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="intro">1. Introduction to Commercial Math</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Commercial math focuses on those aspects of arithmetic that are used in
        everyday life. For example, Eva, your friend, goes to a stationery store
        to buy a notebook. The salesperson tells her that 12 notebooks will cost
        $200. She needs to calculate the cost of 1 notebook. This requires an
        understanding of the unitary method. Let's take another example: Ron
        goes to buy a cricket bat with his mother. One shop offers him a 25%
        discount on the bat, while another offers a free cricket ball with the
        bat. Ron needs to help his mother choose the best deal. He should know
        how to calculate percentages and understand the concept of discounts.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        In both these examples, we use commercial math concepts. You'll continue
        to explore all important topics in Commercial Math by selecting topics
        from the list below:

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="money">2. Money</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Money is what makes the world go round, and arithmetic is the
        centripetal force that governs it. From simple transactions to banking,
        taxes, and discounts, everything that involves money involves math!
        Money is a medium of exchange. We pay coins and notes to obtain services
        and goods. You will now learn more about the process of identifying
        categories and the concept of handling money.
      </p>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgf9aqq8o/image/upload/v1728667854/1_hx3usl.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" alt="">

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="ratio">3. Ratio</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        A ratio tells us how much of the quantity of one thing relates to
        another. The order in which the numbers in a ratio are written matters.
        A ratio is defined as the relationship between the quantities of two or
        more objects, showing how much one object contains within the other. It
        is written in the form of <strong>a:b</strong>, where the first term,
        'a,' is called the antecedent, and the second term, 'b,' is called the
        consequent.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        For example: 1 tablespoon of lemon concentrate + 5 tablespoons of water
        = a perfect lemonade. The ratio to create the perfect lemonade can be
        expressed as Lemon Concentrate: Water = 1:5.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="proportion">4. Proportion</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        When two ratios are identical, they are said to be in proportion. A
        proportion is a mathematical comparison between two numbers. According
        to proportion, if two pairs of given numbers are increasing or
        decreasing in the same ratio, then the ratios are said to be directly
        proportional to each other. Proportions are denoted using the symbols
        ":" or "=".
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        For example: 1:3 and 9:27 are equivalent ratios. They are in proportion
        and represented as 1:3::9:27, which means 1 is to 3 as 9 is to 27.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="rates">5. Rates</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The rate is defined as a given fraction or amount per hundred. It is a
        fraction with 100 as the denominator and is represented by the symbol
        "%". The rate is a fraction or a ratio in which the value of the whole
        is always 100. For example, if Sam scored 30% on his math test, it means
        he scored 30 marks out of 100. It can be written as 30/100 in fraction
        form and 30:100 in terms of ratio.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        You will now learn how to calculate rates and their applications with
        the help of examples.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify"><strong>Example:</strong> What is 30% of 750?</p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> 30% of 750 = (30/100) × 750 = 225.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="unitary">6. Unitary Method</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The unitary method is about finding the “per unit value.” It is a method
        of solving a problem by first finding the value of a single unit and
        then determining the total value by multiplying the single unit value.
        You can try understanding some examples of the Unitary Method to learn
        the strategies used in solving such problems.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Example:</strong> The cost of 4 lemons is $20. The cost of 1
        lemon is 20/4 = $5. So, the cost of 10 lemons = 10 × 5 = $50.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="profit-loss">7. Profit and Loss</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Profit is the gain that occurs when the Selling Price (SP) of a product
        is greater than its Cost Price (CP). Loss is incurred when the Selling
        Price (SP) of a commodity is less than its Cost Price (CP). Profit and
        Loss are the fundamental driving forces of the market, and here you will
        learn how to apply the principles of arithmetic to the commercial world.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Formula for Profit:</strong> Profit = SP - CP
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Formula for Loss:</strong> Loss = CP - SP
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="simple-interest">8. Simple Interest</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Simple Interest is the interest that is calculated on the Principal
        Amount on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. Have you ever borrowed
        money from a friend or family member who said that you would need to
        return the amount after a year with 10% interest? The concept of Simple
        Interest will help you easily calculate the total amount you would need
        to reimburse them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Formula for Simple Interest:</strong> SI = (P × R × T) / 100
      </p>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgf9aqq8o/image/upload/v1728667847/3_ttksek.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" alt="">

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="compound-interest">9. Compound Interest</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Compound Interest is the interest that is calculated on the Principal
        Amount and the interest that has been accumulated from previous terms.
        Compound Interest is usually charged by banks and insurance companies on
        the amount of loan taken by us from them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Formula for Compound Interest:</strong> CI = P(1 + R/100)^T - P
      </p>
      <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgf9aqq8o/image/upload/v1728667847/4_w2bpz0.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px;" alt="">
      

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="discounts">10. Discounts</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        A discount is a reduction in the price of a product. It is the
        difference between the selling price and the market price. Discounts are
        perhaps the most common terms that come up during a shopping trip or any
        purchase we make, as they directly affect the amount of money involved.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Formula for Discount:</strong> Discount = Marked Price - Selling
        Price
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4" id="taxes">11. Taxes</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        The government charges a tax on each item that is sold. This tax is
        meant to be spent on public welfare and is known as tax. The tax charged
        is always a percentage of the SP. You must have heard terms like income
        tax, GST, sales tax, etc., in daily conversations. Now let’s try to
        understand how taxes are applicable to products.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Formula for Tax:</strong> Tax = SP × (Rate of Tax / 100)
      </p>`,
