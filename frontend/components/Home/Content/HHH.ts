      From how many hours we sleep at night to how many laps we do on a race
      track, numbers are an essential part of our daily lives. In mathematics,
      numbers include even and odd, prime and composite numbers, decimals,
      fractions, rational and irrational numbers, natural numbers, integers,
      real numbers, rational, irrational and integer numbers. In this chapter,
      we will learn about the different types of numbers and all the concepts
      associated with them.
    </p>

    <h2>What are Numbers?</h2>
    <p>
      Numbers are a fundamental part of mathematics. Numbers are used to count,
      measure, order and index. We know different types of numbers according to
      their nature such as natural numbers, integers, rational and irrational
      numbers, whole numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, even and odd
      numbers etc. We can apply basic arithmetic operations on numbers and the
      resulting number is . Originally, tally paper was used before numerals
      were used. Now let us introduce the concept of numbers and understand its
      different types and properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Number Definition</h3>
    <p>
      Numbers are mathematical values ​​that are represented by words, symbols
      or numbers that represent quantities. Numbers are used for counting and
      calculations.
    </p>

    <h3>Introduction to Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Numbers form the basis of mathematics. To understand mathematics you need
      to become familiar with numbers. There are different types of numbers.
      There is a long list including ordinals, consecutive numbers, odd, even,
      natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, real numbers, rational numbers,
      irrational numbers, and complex numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to numbers, you will also encounter the interesting world of
      divisors and multiples. This world includes primes, composite numbers,
      coprimes, perfect numbers (yes, numbers can be perfect!), HCF, P/E, and
      prime factorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start your numbers journey. You can explore all the important topics in
      Numbers by choosing a topic from the list below.

    <h3>Math Before Number Building</h3>
    <p>
      Building skills before number building is a prerequisite for understanding
      numbers. Pre-quantification skills like allocating, sorting, classifying,
      arranging and comparing are the foundation for a deep understanding of
      numbers. Pre-school math skills are taught in kindergarten. Children learn
      how to stand before they can take even a small step. Similarly,
      pre-quantification concepts are very important for children to start
      understanding mathematics. In this section, we will discuss various
      pre-quantification concepts like allocating and sorting, comparing and
      ordering, classifying, shapes and patterns, etc.

    <h3>Number Names</h3>
    <p>
      Number names are utilized to speak to numbers in an in sequential order
      arrange. A particular word is utilized to allude to each number. To type
      in a number in words in English, we ought to know the put esteem of each
      digit within the number.

    <h3>PEMDAS</h3>
    <p>
      The rules of PEMDAS layout the arrange of the operations and allow
      structure to settled operations. In science, PEMDAS is an acronym that
      stands for P- Brackets, E- Types, M- Increase, D- Division, A- Expansion,
      and S- Subtraction.

    <h3>Number Systems</h3>
    <p>
      The decimal number framework is the foremost commonly utilized number
      framework . The digits to 9 are utilized to speak to numbers. A digit in
      any given number includes a put esteem. The decimal number framework is
      the standard framework for signifying integrability and non-integers. We
      utilize the decimal number framework for the representation of Numbers up
      to 2-Digits , Numbers up to 3-Digits , Numbers up to 4-Digits , Numbers up
      to 5-Digits , Numbers up to 6-Digits , Numbers up to 7-Digits , Numbers up
      to 8-Digits , Numbers up to 9-Digits and Numbers up to 10-Digits ..
    </p>

    <h3>Sorts of Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      The diverse sorts of numbers depend on the properties that they have. For
      illustration, normal numbers are checking numbers that begin from 1,
      whereas, whole numbers begin from 0, prime numbers are as it were
      detachable by 1 and the number itself, and so on. Let us learn more almost
      the diverse sorts of numbers within the taking after areas.
    </p>

    <h3>Numbers Chart</h3>
    <p>
      There are distinctive sorts of numbers that are utilized, but the foremost
      commonly utilized numbers can be classified as per their special
      properties. Observe the numbers chart which appears the sorts of numbers
      that are included beneath genuine numbers and all numbers separated from
      real numbers are named as complex numbers.
    </p>

    <h3>Cardinal Numbers and Ordinal Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      A cardinal number could be a number that indicates the tally of any
      question. Any common number such as 1, 2, 3, etc., is alluded to as a
      cardinal number, though, an ordinal number could be a number that
      indicates the position or put of an protest. For illustration, 1st, 2nd,
      3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. It shows the arrange of things or objects, such as to
      begin with, moment, third, fourth, and so on.
    </p>

    <h4>Illustration:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the table given underneath which appears the contrast between
      Cardinal numbers and Ordinal numbers. Ordinal numbers offer assistance
      characterize the position of the children. Such as, Jim is the fourth
      child from the cleared out.

      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />

    <h3>Sequential Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Sequential numbers are numbers that take after each other in arrange from
      the littlest number to the biggest number. They ordinarily have a
      distinction of 1 between each two numbers.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the figure given underneath which appears a list of sequential
      numbers.
    </p>

      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />

    <h3>Integrability</h3>
    <p>
      Integrability are numbers that comprise of entirety numbers and negative
      numbers. All integrability are spoken to by the letter set Z and do not
      have a decimal or a fragmentary portion. A number line is full of
      integrability. On the cleared out side, you'll find negative integers
      while on the correct side you have the positive ones. Do not disregard the
      zero in between!
    </p>
    <p>Z = { ...., -4, -3, -2, -1, , 1, 2, 3, 4,....}</p>

    <h3>Natural Numbers and Entirety Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Natural Numbers and Entirety Numbers A common number may be a non-negative
      numbers and is always greater than zero. It is spoken to by the image N.
      It ought to be famous that entire numbers don't contain any decimal or
      fragmentary portion. They are spoken to by the image W.
    </p>

    <h3>Common numbers and entirety numbers - Representation</h3>
    <h4>Indeed Numbers and Odd Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      Indeed numbers are those numbers that can be partitioned into two rise to
      bunches or sets and are precisely detachable by 2. For illustration, 2, 4,
      6, 8, 10, and so on. In other words, these are entire numbers that are
      precisely distinct by 2.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the taking after figure which appears that indeed numbers are
      totally detachable by 2.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgf9aqq8o/image/upload/v1728667845/numbers-1-8_ouug6f.png"
      alt=""
      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />
    <p>
      Odd numbers are entire numbers that cannot be totally partitioned by 2.
      These numbers cannot be orchestrated in sets. Interests, all the entirety
      numbers but the products of 2 are odd numbers.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the taking after figure which appears that odd numbers are not
      totally distinct by 2 and when they are isolated by 2 we get 1 as the
      leftover portion.
    </p>
    <img

      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />
    <p>
      Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers A prime number could be a number that
      has precisely two components, 1 and the number itself. For illustration,
      2, 5, 7, 11, and so on are prime numbers . It can be said that any
      entirety number more noteworthy than 1 that has precisely two components,
      1 and itself is characterized to be a prime number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, presently we know that a prime number has fair two factors,1 and the
      number itself. A composite number may be a number that has more than two
      variables, which suggests it can be separated by the number 1 and itself,
      and at slightest one more numbers. It can too be said that any number more
      noteworthy than 1 that's not a prime number, is characterized to be a
      composite number. Composite numbers continuously have more than 2
      variables. For illustration, 6, 8, 9, 12, and so on are composite numbers
      since these numbers have more than 2 variables.
    </p>
    <pre>
Variables of 6 = 1, 2, 3, 6 (variables other than 1 and 6)
Components of 8 = 1, 2, 4, 8 (variables other than 1 and 8)
Components of 9 = 1, 3, 9 (variables other than 1 and 9)
Components of 12 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 (variables other than 1 and 12)
                    </pre
    >

    <h3>Co-prime Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      In the event that a match of numbers has no common figure separated from
      1, at that point they are called co-prime numbers . In other words, a set
      of numbers or integrability which have as it were 1 as their common
      calculate, which suggests their most elevated common figure (HCF) will be
      1, are co-primes. These are too known as commonly prime numbers or
      relatively prime numbers. Too, there ought to be two numbers in arrange to
      create co-primes.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      The taking after figure appears two co-prime numbers 8 and 15 that have as
      it were 1 as their common figure.
    </p>
    <img

      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />

    <h3>Culminate Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Idealize numbers are the positive integrability that are rise to to the
      entirety of its components but for the number itself. In other words,
      culminate numbers are the positive integrability that are the entirety of
      their appropriate divisors . The littlest culminate number is 6, which is
      the whole of its appropriate divisors: 1, 2 and 3
    </p>
    <h5>Illustration</h5>
    <p>
      The taking after figure appears that 6 could be a culminate number since
      the entirety of its variables (1,2,3) leads to 6.
    </p>

    <h3>Divisions and Decimals</h3>
    <p>
      Divisions are a portion of a entire. They are spoken to by numbers that
      have two parts to them and they are isolated by a division bar. There's a
      number at the best, which is called the numerator , and the number at the
      foot is called the denominator .
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      The taking after figure appears a division in which 1 is the numerator and
      4 is the denominator.
    </p>

    <h3>Complex Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      A complex number may be a number that can be communicated within the frame
      (a + bi) where a and b are genuine numbers, and i could be a arrangement
      of the condition x 2 = −1. Since no genuine number fulfills this
      condition, i is called an fanciful number . Complex numbers have a genuine
      portion and an imaginary portion. Hold up, do you think Complex numbers
      are really complex? Well, let us think about them in detail to find out.
      In this section, we cover distinctive subjects like Complex Numbers –
      Focuses within the Plane, A Complex Number could be a Point within the
      Plane, What is i? Size and Contention, Powers of particle , Expansion, and
      Subtraction of Complex Numbers, Increase of Complex Numbers, Conjugate of
      a Complex Number , Division of Complex Numbers, Addition, Subtraction, and
      Elucidation of |z1-z2|.
    </p>
    <h4>Case:</h4>
    <p>
      Watch the figure given underneath which appears that a complex number
      comprises of genuine numbers and an nonexistent portion
    </p>

      style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%"
    />

    <h3>Variables and Products</h3>
    <p>
      Variables and products are the two key concepts that are examined
      together. Variables are the numbers that separate the given number totally
      without clearing out any leftover portion, though the products are the
      numbers that are duplicated by the other number to induce particular
      numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Components of a given number are numbers that can flawlessly partition
      that given number.
    </p>
    <h5>Cases:</h5>
    <pre>
Components of 6:
1, 2, 3, 6
Components of 8:
1, 2, 4, 8
Variables of 14:
1, 2, 7, 14
Components of 36:
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 18, 36
</pre
    >
    <p>
      A multiple of a number could be a number gotten by duplicating the given
      number by another entirety number.
    </p>
    <h5>Cases:</h5>
    <pre>
Products of 3:
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ......
Products of 5:
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, .....
Products of 10:
10, 20, 30, 40, 50,...
Products of 12:
12, 24, 36, 48, 60, ....
    </pre>
    <p>Most elevated Common Calculate (HCF)</p>
    <p>
      The Most elevated Common Calculate (HCF) of the two numbers is the biggest
      entirety number which may be a figure of both. It is additionally called
      the Most prominent Common Factor(GCF) .
    </p>
    <h5>Case:</h5>
    <p>
      Watch the following figure which appears the HCF of 15 and 21 which is 3.

    />

    <h3>Slightest Common Different (LCM)</h3>
    <p>
      When we consider two numbers, each will have its claim set of products. A
      few products will be common to both numbers. The littlest of these common
      products is called the Slightest Common Numerous (LCM) of the two numbers.
    </p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <p>
      Observe the taking after figure which appears the LCM of 8 and 10 which is
      40.

    />

    <h3>Prime Factorization</h3>
    <p>
      Prime factorization permits us to write any number as a item of prime
      components. It could be a way of communicating a number as a item of its
      prime components. To do prime factorization, we got to break a number down
      to its prime variables.
    </p>
    <h5>Case:</h5>
    <p>
      Watch the figure given underneath which appears the prime factorization of
      12

    <h3>Properties of Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      The fundamental properties of numbers that are utilized in arithmetic are:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Commutative Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        This property of numbers pertains to addition and multiplication. It is
        expressed as: a + b = b + a and a × b = b × a.
      </dd>

      <dt>Associative Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        This property of numbers pertains to addition and multiplication. It is
        expressed as: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a × (b × c) = (a × b) × c.
      </dd>

      <dt>Distributive Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        The product of the sum of two numbers and a third number is equal to the
        sum of the product of each addend and the third number. It is expressed
        as: a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c.
      </dd>

      <dt>Identity Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        There is an additive identity equal to 0 and a multiplicative identity
        equal to 1. It is expressed as: a + 0 = a and a × 1 = a.
      </dd>

      <dt>Reflexive Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        This property states that each number is equal to itself. It is
        expressed as: for all a, a = a.
      </dd>

      <dt>Symmetric Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        If a number x is equal to y, then y is also equal to x. It is expressed
        as: if x = y, then y = x.
      </dd>

      <dt>Transitive Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        If x is equal to y and y is equal to z, then we can say that x is equal
        to z. It is expressed as: if x = y and y = z, then x = z.
      </dd>

      <dt>Inverse Property:</dt>
      <dd>
        When an arithmetic operation is applied between a number and its
        inverse, we get the identity. It is expressed as: a + (-a) = 0 and a ×
        (1/a) = 1.
      </dd>
    </dl>

  measurement: `<p>
        Measurement is the process of comparing an unknown quantity with a
        standard, known value. The outcome is usually expressed as a numerical
        value accompanied by a unit. We use measurement to quantify various
        attributes such as length, mass, volume, and temperature. This article
        explores the basics of measurement, conversions, and the various units
        used.

        <h2>What is Measurement?</h2>
        <p>
          Measurement is the method by which we determine the size, amount, or
          degree of something using numbers. For instance, comparing two rods
          without precise figures only gives limited information, but by stating
          that one rod is 20 inches and another is 15 inches, we understand the
          difference clearly – the first rod is 5 inches longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In mathematics, measurement is a key area that encompasses the study
          of units, conversions, and measuring quantities such as length, mass,
          and time. It also connects with other branches like geometry
          (measuring areas and volumes), trigonometry (heights and distances),
          and algebra (expressing relationships using variables). Before we dive
          into different units, let's first familiarize ourselves with some
          common abbreviations for measurement units.
        </p>

        <h3>Common Measurement Abbreviations:</h3>

        <h2>Measurement Units</h2>
        <p>
          There are several units depending on what is being measured. For
          example, the units for length include meters and inches, while mass
          can be measured in grams or pounds. Measurement systems are divided
          into two main categories: the Metric System and the U.S. Standard
          System (Imperial System). The metric system uses millimeters,
          centimeters, and meters, while the U.S. system relies on inches, feet,
          and miles.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Measurement Conversion</h2>
        <p>
          In order to perform calculations or comparisons, units need to be
          converted to a common form. For example, you can add 10 meters to 12
          meters to get 22 meters, but you can't add meters to inches without
          first converting one to the other. Conversion charts and formulas help
          us transition between units in the same or different systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters, converting 5 inches
          would involve multiplying 5 by 2.54, resulting in 12.7 centimeters.
          Similarly, we can convert between the Metric and U.S. systems.
        </p>

  algebra: `
  <p class="lead">
        Algebra is a fundamental area of mathematics that focuses on expressing
        problems or scenarios using mathematical symbols. It incorporates
        variables such as <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>, and
        <strong>z</strong> alongside mathematical operations like addition,
        subtraction, multiplication, and division to create meaningful
        expressions. Algebra is essential to various mathematical disciplines,
        including trigonometry, calculus, and coordinate geometry. A simple
        algebraic expression could be represented as
        <strong>2x + 4 = 8</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, algebra deals with symbols representing numbers or values
        that can change, connected by operators. It's not merely a mathematical
        concept; it’s a skill we often use in our daily lives, often without
        realizing it. Understanding algebra is crucial, as it provides a
        foundation for all future mathematical topics you will encounter.
      </p>

      <h3>1. What is Algebra?</h3>
      <p>
        Algebra is a branch of mathematics that utilizes symbols to represent
        numbers and the arithmetic operations applied to them. These symbols,
        known as variables, do not have fixed values. In practical situations,
        we frequently encounter changing values, which algebra helps to express.
        Variables such as <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong>,
        <strong>z</strong>, <strong>p</strong>, or <strong>q</strong> represent
        these values, and through various arithmetic operations—addition,
        subtraction, multiplication, and division—we can manipulate these
        symbols to find specific values.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Algebraic Equation</strong>: Algebraic expressions consist of
        variables, operators, and constants. For instance, in the expression
        <strong>2x + 4 = 8</strong>, the numbers <strong>4</strong> and
        <strong>8</strong> are constants, while <strong>x</strong> represents

        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction to Trigonometry</h2>
        <p>Trigonometry is a core branch of mathematics. The name comes from the Greek words "Trigonon" (triangle) and "Metron" (measure). It studies the relationships between the angles and sides of a right-angled triangle. Various trigonometric formulas and identities allow you to calculate the unknown dimensions of a triangle based on known values.</p>

            <li>b² = a² + c² - 2ac cos B</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> represent the lengths of the sides of the triangle and <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em> represent the angles.</p>

        <p>Trigonometry has practical applications in many fields, including architecture, navigation, astronomy, and physics. It is used, for example, to determine the height of structures based on angle measurements, and also in sky calculations and electronics.</p>
        
        <h3>Real-life Trigonometry Example</h3>
        <p>Imagine someone standing next to a tree and wants to know its height without physically measuring it. If you know the distance from the tree and the elevation angle, you can use the tangent function to determine the height:</p>
        <p><em>tan θ = height / distance</em></p>
        
        <p>For example, if the distance is 30 meters and the elevation angle is 45°, the tree is 30 meters tall because:</p>
        <p><em>height = distance × tan(θ) = 30 m × tan(45°) = 30 m</em></p>

  calculus: `
  <div id="learnSection" class="learnSection">
<p><strong>Calculus</strong> is one of the most important branches of mathematics that deals with rate of change and motion. The two major concepts that calculus is based on are derivatives and integrals.</p>
<ul>
<li>The derivative of a function is the measure of the rate of change of a function. It gives an explanation of the function at a specific point.</li>
<li>The integral is the measure of the area under the curve of the function. It accumulates the discrete values of a function over a range of values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculus is also referred to as infinitesimal calculus or “the calculus of infinitesimals”. Infinitesimal numbers are quantities that have a value nearly equal to zero, but not exactly zero. Generally, classical calculus is the study of continuous changes of functions.</p>

</div>
<p>Calculus focuses on some important topics covered in math such as differentiation, integration, limits, functions, and so on. Calculus, a branch of mathematics, deals with the study of the rate of change and it was developed by Newton and Leibniz.</p>
<p><strong>Calculus Definition:</strong> Calculus in mathematics is generally used in mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions and thus helps in understanding the changes between the values related by a function. Calculus is broadly classified into two different sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Differential Calculus</li>
<li>Integral Calculus</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="description of important calculus terms" src="/content/calculus/1.png" style="width: 400px;"></p>
<p>Both differential calculus and integral calculus serve as a foundation for the higher branch of Mathematics known as “Analysis”, dealing with the impact of a slight change in the dependent variable, as it leads to zero, on the function.</p>
<p><img alt="branches of calculus are differential calculus and the integral calculus" src="/content/calculus/2.png" style="width: 400px;"></p>
<div id="topics">
<h3>Precalculus</h3>
<p><a>Precalculus</a> in mathematics is a course that includes <a>trigonometry</a> and <a>algebra</a> designed to prepare students for the study of calculus. In precalculus, we focus on the study of advanced mathematical concepts including functions and quantitative reasoning. Some important topics covered under precalculus are,</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Functions</b></li>
<li><b>Inverse Functions</b></li>
<li><b>Trigonometric Functions</b></li>
<li><b>Complex Numbers</b></li>
<li><b>Rational Function</b></li>
</ul>
<div id="functions">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2>Functions</h2>
</div>
<p>Functions in calculus represent the relationship between two variables, which are the independent variable and the dependent variable. Let’s consider the following diagram.</p>
<p><img alt="explanation of function as a part of calculus" src="/content/calculus/3.png" style="width: 400px;"></p>
<p><img alt="formula used in calculus" src="/content/calculus/4.png" style="width: 450px;"></p>
<p>There is an INPUT, a function, and an OUTPUT. For example, suppose we want to make a pizza. We would need the following basic ingredients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pizza Base</li>
<li>Pizza Sauce</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
<li>Seasoning</li>
</ul>
<p>The above real-life example can be represented in the form of a function as explained below,</p>
<p><img alt="example of a pizza showing relation between input and output. It is labelled as function example in calculus" src="/content/calculus/4.png" style="width: 400px;"></p>
<p>Let’s take another example</p>
<p>Suppose that: y = x<sup>2</sup></p>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col"><strong>Value of x</strong></th>
<th scope="col"><strong>Value of y</strong></th>

</table>
<p>Using the diagram given above, we get:</p>
<p><img alt="formula of function" src="/content/calculus/5.png" style="width: 400px;"></p>
<p>We can see that the value of y <strong>depends</strong> on the value of x. We can conclude that, in calculus,</p>
<ul>
<li>INPUT (x) is independent of the OUTPUT (y)</li>
<li>OUTPUT depends on the INPUT</li>
<li>f(x) is responsible for the transformation of the INPUT to the OUTPUT and is called a "function"</li>
</ul>
<div id="diff">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2>Differential Calculus</h2>
</div>
<p>Differential calculus focuses on solving the problem of finding the <a>rate of change</a> of a function with respect to the other variables. To find the optimal solution, derivatives are used to calculate the <a>maxima and minima</a> values of a function. Differential helps in the study of the limit of a quotient, dealing with variables such as x and y, functions f(x), and the corresponding changes in the variables x and y. The notations dy and dx are known as differentials. The process used to find the derivatives is called <a>differentiation</a>. The derivative of a function, y with respect to variable x, is represented by dy/dx or f’(x).</p>
<p><strong>Limits</strong></p>
<p>Limit helps in calculating the degree of closeness to any value or the approaching term. A limit is normally expressed using the <a>limit formula</a> as,</p>
<p>lim<sub>x→c</sub>f(x) = A</p>
<p>This expression is read as “the limit of f of x as x approaches c equals A”.</p>
<p><strong>Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>Derivatives represent the <a>instantaneous rate of change</a> of a quantity with respect to the other. The derivative of a function is represented as:</p>
<p>lim<sub>x→h</sub>[f(x + h) − f(x)]/h = A</p>
<p><strong>Continuity</strong></p>
<p>A function f(x) is said to be <a>continuous</a> at a particular point x = a, if the following three conditions are satisfied –</p>
<ul>
<li>f(a) is defined</li>
<li>lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x) exists</li>
<li>lim<sub>x→a</sub>f(x) = f(a)</li>

<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2>Integral Calculus</h2>
</div>
<p>Integral calculus is the study of integrals and the properties associated to them. It is helpful in:</p>
<ul>
<li>calculating f from f’ (i.e. from its derivative).</li>
<li>calculating the <a>area under a curve</a> for any function.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Integration</strong></p>
<p>Integration is the reverse process of differentiation. As differentiation can be understood as dividing a part into many small parts, integration can be said as a collection of small parts in order to form a whole. It is generally used for calculating areas.</p>
<p><strong>Indefinite Integral</strong></p>
<p>An <a>indefinite integral</a> does not have a specific boundary, i.e. no upper and lower limit is defined. Thus the integration value is always accompanied by a constant value (C). It is denoted as:</p>
<p>∫ f(x) dx = F(x) + C, where F'(x) = f(x)</p>
<p><strong>Definite Integral</strong></p>
<p>A <a>definite integral</a> has a specific boundary or limit for the calculation of the function. The upper and lower limits of the independent variable of a function are specified. A definite integral is given mathematically as,</p>
<p>∫<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup> f(x) · dx = F(x)</p>
<div id="formula">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2>Calculus Formula</h2>
</div>
<p>Calculus formulas can be broadly divided into the following six broad sets of formulas. The six broad formulas are related to limits, differentiation, <a>integration</a>, definite integrals, application of differentiation, and differential equations.</p>
<p><strong>Limits Formulas:</strong> Limits formulas help in approximating the limit of a function at a given point.</p>
<p>lim<sub>x→0</sub> (x<sup>n</sup> - a<sup>n</sup>)(x - a) = na<sup>(n - 1)</sup><br>
lim<sub>x→0</sub> (sin x)/x = 1<br>
lim<sub>x→0 </sub>(tan x)/x = 1<br>
lim<sub>x→0 </sub>(e<sup>x</sup> - 1)/x = 1<br>
lim<sub>x→0</sub> (a<sup>x</sup> - 1)/x = log<sub>e</sub>a<br>
lim<sub>x→∞</sub> (1 + (1/x))<sup>x</sup> = e<br>
lim<sub>x→0</sub> (1 + x)<sup>1/x</sup> = e<br>
lim<sub>x→0 </sub>(1 + (a/x))<sup>x</sup> = e<sup>a</sup></p>
<p><strong>Differentiation Formulas: </strong><a>Differentiation Formulas</a> are applicable to basic algebraic expressions, trigonometric ratios, inverse trigonometry, and exponential terms.</p>
<p><a>d/dx (x<sup>n</sup>)</a> = nx<sup>n - 1 </sup><br>
d/dx (Constant) = 0<br>
<a>d/dx (e<sup>x</sup>)</a> = e<sup>x</sup><br>
d/dx (a<sup>x</sup>) = a<sup>x</sup> · ln a<br>
<a>d/dx (ln x)</a> = 1/x<br>
<a>d/dx (sin x)</a> = cos x<br>
<a>d/dx (cos x)</a> = -sin x<br>
<a>d/dx (tan x)</a> = sec<sup>2</sup>x<br>
<a>d/dx (cot x)</a> = -cosec<sup>2</sup>x<br>
<a>d/dx (sec x)</a> = sec x · tan x<br>
<a>d/dx (cosec x)</a> = -cosec x · cot x</p>
<p><strong>Integration Formula:</strong> <a>Integrals formulas</a> can be derived from differentiation formulas, and are complimentary to differentiation formulas.</p>
<p><a>∫ x<sup>n</sup> dx</a> = x<sup>n + 1</sup>/(n + 1) + C<br>
<a>∫ 1 dx</a> = x + C<br>
<a>∫ e<sup>x</sup> dx</a> = e<sup>x</sup> + C<br>
<a>∫(1/x) dx</a> = ln |x| + C<br>
∫ a<sup>x</sup> dx = (a<sup>x</sup>/log a) + C<br>
<a>∫ cos x dx</a> = sin x + C<br>
<a>∫ sin x dx</a> = -cos x + C<br>
∫ sec<sup>2</sup>x dx = tan x + C<br>
∫ cosec<sup>2</sup>x dx = -cot x + C<br>
<a>∫ sec x tan x dx</a> = sec x + C<br>
∫ cosec x cot x dx = -cosec x + C</p>
<p><strong>Definite Integrals Formulas: </strong>Definite integrals are the basic integral formulas and are additionally having limits. There is an upper and a lower limit in definite integrals, that are helpful in finding the area within these limits.</p>
<p>∫<sup>b</sup><sub>a</sub> f'(x) dx = f(b) - f(a), this is known as <a>fundamental theorem of calculus</a><br>
∫<sup>b</sup><sub>a</sub> f(x) dx = ∫<sup>b</sup><sub>a</sub> f(t) dt<br>
∫<sup>b</sup><sub>a</sub> f(x) dx = - ∫<sup>a</sup><sub>b</sub> f(x) dx<br>
∫<sup>b</sup><sub>a</sub> f(x) dx = ∫<sup>c</sup><sub>a</sub> f(x) dx + ∫<sup>b</sup><sub>c</sub> f(x) dx<br>
∫<sup>b</sup><sub>a</sub> f(x) dx = ∫<sup>b</sup><sub>a</sub> f(a + b - x) dx<br>
∫<sup>a</sup><sub>0</sub> f(x) dx = ∫<sup>a</sup><sub>0</sub> f(a - x) dx<br>
∫<sup>a</sup><sub>-a</sub> f(x) dx = 2∫<sup>a</sup><sub>0</sub> f(x) dx, f is an even function<br>
∫<sup>a</sup><sub>-a</sub> f(x) dx = 0 , f is an odd function</p>
<p><strong>Application of Differentiation Formulas:</strong> The application of differentiation formulas is useful for <a>approximation</a>, estimation of values, equations of <a>tangents and normals</a>, maxima and minima, and for finding the changes of numerous physical events.</p>
<p>dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt)<br>
<a>Equation of a Tangent</a>: y - y<sub>1</sub> = dy/dx · (x - x<sub>1</sub>)<br>
Equation of a Normal: y - y<sub>1</sub> = -1/(dy/dx) · (x - x<sub>1</sub>)</p>
<p><strong>Differential Equations Formula: </strong><a>Differential equations</a> are equations involved with derivatives. In the general equation, we have the unknown variable 'x' and here we have the differentiation dy/dx as the variable of the equation.</p>
<p><a>Homogeneous Differential Equation</a>: f(λx, λy) = λ<sup>n</sup>f(x, y)<br>
<a>Linear Differential Equation</a>: dy/dx + Py = Q. The general solution of linear differential equation is y.e<sup>- </sup><sup>∫P dx </sup>= ∫(Q · e<sup>∫P dx</sup>) dx + C</p>

<p>Commercial math focuses on those aspects of mathematics that are used in everyday life. Consider an example<span style="background-color:null;">; Eva, your friend goes to a stationary shop to buy a notebook. The shopkeeper tells her that 12 notebooks will cost $200. She has to calculate the cost of 1 notebook. This requires an understanding of the unitary method. Let’s take another example; Ron goes to buy a cricket bat with his mother. One shop offers him a 25% discount on the bat. The other shop offers a free cricket ball with the bat. Ron wants to help his mother select the best deal. He should know how to calculate percentages and also understand the concept of discounts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2><span style="color:null;">Money</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Money is what makes the world go round, and mathematics is the centripetal force that governs it. From simple transactions to banking, taxes, and discounts, everything that involves money, involves math! <a>Money</a> is a medium of exchange. We pay coins and notes in order to get services and commodities. You can now learn more about the process of <a>identifying denominations</a> and the concept of <a>decomposing money</a>.</p>
<p>All transactions are done using the country’s system of money i.e. currency. Money is something that we all interact with in some way on a daily basis and we end up falling back on our math skills to handle that money reliably.</p>
<p><img alt="sum of two 5 Rs. coins" src="/content/comercial-maths/1.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 300px;"></p>
<div id="Ratio">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2><span style="color:null;">Ratio</span></h2>
</div>
<p>A ratio tells us how much of the proportion of one thing to the other. The sequence (or order) in which the <span style="background-color:null;"><a>numbers</a>&nbsp;</span>in a ratio are written matters.&nbsp;The ratio is defined as the relation between the quantities of two or more objects and it indicates the amount of one object contained in the other. It is written in the form of a:b, where the first term, i.e 'a' is known as antecedent and the second term, i.e 'b' is known as consequent. Let's go ahead and learn about the concept of <a>Ratios</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>1 tablespoon of lemon concentrate+ 5 tablespoon of water = a perfect lemonade. The ratio to get a perfect lemonade can be expressed as Lemon Concentrate: Water = 1:5.</p>
<div id="proportion">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2><span style="color:null;">Proportion</span></h2>
</div>
<p>When two ratios are equivalent, they are said to be in proportion. Proportion is a mathematical comparison between two numbers.&nbsp; According to proportion, if two sets of given numbers are increasing or decreasing in the same ratio, then the ratios are said to be directly proportional to each other. Proportions are denoted using the symbol&nbsp; "::" or "=". Check out the examples of <a>Proportion</a> to understand the concept better.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>1:3 and 9:27 are equivalent ratios. They are in proportion. It is represented as 1:3::9:27. And is read as 1 is to 3 as 9 is to 27.</p>
<div id="Percentages">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2><span style="color:null;">Percentages</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The percentage is defined as a given part or amount in every hundred. It is a fraction with 100 as the denominator and is represented by the symbol "%". The percentage is a fraction or a ratio in which the value of the whole is always 100. For example, if Sam scored 30% marks on his math test, it means that he scored 30 marks out of 100. It is written as 30/100 in the fraction form and 30:100 in terms of ratio. Percent means “out of 100”. If 20 out of 100 boxes are shaded, then we say that 20 percent or 20 of the boxes are shaded. You can now learn how to calculate <a>Percentages</a> and their applications with the help of examples.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>What is 30% of 750?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> 30% of 750 = (30/100) × 750 = 225.</p>
<div id="Unitary-Method">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2 id="unitary-method"><span style="color:null;">Unitary Method</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The unitary method, in essence, is all about finding the “per unit value”. The unitary method is a technique for solving a problem by first finding the value of a single unit, and then finding the necessary value by multiplying the single unit value. You can try solving some of the examples of the&nbsp;<a>Unitary Method</a> to understand the methods used in solving such problems.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>The cost of 4 lemons is $20. The cost of 1 lemon is 20/4 = $5. So, the cost of 10 lemons= 10 × 5 = $50.</p>
<div id="Profit-and-Loss">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2><span style="color:null;">Profit and Loss</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Profit is the gain that is incurred when the Selling Price (SP) of a commodity is greater than its Cost Price (CP). Loss is incurred when the Selling Price (SP) of a commodity is less than its Cost Price (CP). <a>Profit and Loss</a> are the basic driving forces of the market, and here you will understand how to wield the power of mathematics and apply it to the commercial world.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="formula of profit and loss" src="/content/comercial-maths/2.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 300px;"></p>
<div id="Simple-Interest">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2><span style="color:null;">Simple Interest</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Simple Interest is the interest that is calculated on the Principal Amount on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. Ever borrow money from a friend or relative and they said that you would have to return the amount after a year with 10% interest? The concept of <a>Simple Interest</a> will help you easily calculate the total amount you would need to repay them.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="formula for simple interest" src="/content/comercial-maths/3.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 400px;"></p>
<div id="Compound-Interest">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2><span style="color:null;">Compound Interest</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Compound Interest is the interest that is calculated on the Principal Amount and the Interest that is obtained from the previous term. <a>Compound Interest</a> is usually charged by banks and insurance companies on the amount of loan taken by us from them.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="formula for compound interest" src="/content/comercial-maths/4.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 400px;"></p>
<div id="Discounts">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2><span style="color:null;">Discounts</span></h2>
</div>
<p>Discount is a reduction in the price of a commodity. It is the difference between the selling price and market price. <a>Discounts</a> are probably the most frequent terms that come up during a shopping trip or any purchase that we make since they directly affect the amount of money involved.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="formula for discounts" src="/content/comercial-maths/5.png" style="max-width: 100%; width: 300px;"></p>
<div id="Taxes">
<div id="circle" style="background-color: rgb(225, 255, 246);"></div><h2><span style="color:null;">Taxes</span></h2>
</div>
<p>The government charges a fee on every item that is sold. This fee is meant to be spent on public welfare and is known as tax. The tax charged is always a percentage of the SP. You must have heard words like income tax, GST, service tax, etc in daily conversations. Let’s now try and understand how <a>Taxes</a> are levied on products.</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong>A packet of homemade chocolates costs $50. A service tax of 10% is charged. What will be the total bill amount?</p>
<p><strong>Solution: </strong></p>
<p>Cost Price= $50</p>
<p>Service Tax= 50 × 10/100 = $5</p>
<p>The total bill amount including taxes= Cost price + Tax = $50 + $5 = $55.</p>
