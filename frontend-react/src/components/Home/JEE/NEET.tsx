            <h1> What Does NEET Symbolize? – NEET Full Form In Medical</h1>
            <p>
              NEET stands for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test. It is a
              single-level national exam carried out for medical aspirants
              enabling them to seek admissions to medical courses across
              different medical institutes of the country. From the year 2020
              onwards, the exam has emerged as the only medical entrance exam
              that has to be qualified to seek admission even to AIIMS and
              JIPMER institutes thereby scrapping the multiple entrance exams
              that were carried out previously at state levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              The government of India introduced NEET as a plan to conduct one
              exam replacing multiple exams that were being conducted as part of
              the One Nation One Examination policy. NEET is an offline test
              carried out in a pen-paper mode, standing as the only medical
              entrance exam at UG level, to be following this model.
            </p>
            <h2>Who Is Eligible For NEET?</h2>
            <p>
              In order for students to be able to appear for NEET, the minimum
